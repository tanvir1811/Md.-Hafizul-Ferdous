           <h1>About Civil Law</h1>
        </section>
                <p>The civil law of Bangladesh is a framework of rules governing private rights and obligations, and it draws heavily from both English common law and traditional Islamic principles, reflecting the country's legal history and cultural context. Here's a brief overview:<br/>

                    1. Legal Framework: The primary sources of civil law in Bangladesh include statutes, case law, and customary law. Key statutes include the Bangladesh Penal Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Contracts Act, and the Transfer of Property Act.<br/>
                    
                    2. Civil Procedure: The Code of Civil Procedure governs the process of civil litigation, including the procedures for filing suits, handling evidence, and appeals. It is designed to ensure fair and orderly resolution of disputes.<br/>
                    
                    3. Contract Law: The Contracts Act of 1872 provides the framework for the formation, performance, and enforcement of contracts. It covers aspects like contract formation, breach, and remedies.<br/>
                    
                    4. Property Law: The Transfer of Property Act of 1882 deals with the transfer of property between individuals. It outlines rules for sale, lease, mortgage, and other forms of property transfer.<br/>
                    
                    5. Family Law: Family law in Bangladesh incorporates elements from Islamic law, Hindu law, and statutory law. It addresses issues like marriage, divorce, and inheritance, with specific provisions for different religious communities.<br/>
                    
                    6. Inheritance: Inheritance laws are influenced by religious practices, particularly Islamic law for Muslims and Hindu law for Hindus, determining the distribution of a deceased person’s estate.
                    
                    Overall, Bangladesh’s civil law system aims to balance traditional practices with modern legal principles, striving for justice and fairness in personal and property-related matters.</p>
